# ChimpToken and Truffle
Yet another eth ERC20 token example on Truffle? Yes because all tutorials cover the easy peasy compile and deploy on testrpc but none of them is useful to deploy from turllfe to a real network. Here we use ropsten.


# Pre-requisites
This has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, but I'm confident can work on other OS as well.
```
Truffle v3.4.11 (core: 3.4.11) with Solidity v0.4.15 (solc-js)
Open zeppelin 1.3.0
Geth 1.7.2-stable-1db4ecdc
Ethereum Wallet V 0.9.2 (optional, to mess around with transactions and UI)
```

# My stack
I launched Ubuntu 14.04 VM on Parallels/MacOsX. In my MAC I have also Chrome with Metamask as a second wallet to launch payments back and forth.  


# Install openzeppelin

Get into the root folder of your project and launch

```
npm install zeppelin-solidity
```

# Syncing the chain

geth requires all the chain to be local. This may take time, but you need it. So relax and get your chain in sync.


# How to know when I'm synced

If you're using the Ethereum Wallet it is telling you if it is syncing or it is up to date. If you're syncing with the geth terminal then it is a bit trickier. See console usage below.


# Geth Console usage

This is not a tutorial on geth commands, however lets go through few useful instructions. 
This will launch geth as a rpc server. 
```
parallels@ubuntu:~$ geth --testnet --rpc --rpcapi="db,eth,net,web3,personal,web3"
```


Now open a second bash terminal and attach to the running geth node typing
```
geth attach http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

From now on you have two geth(s), one instance is the node, the second one is just a javascipt terminal attached to the first one.

On the attached console, while geth is syncing, you can launch commands like:

```
> web3.eth.blockNumber
2003004
```
Important! The outcome must be equal to the block number you see in a block explorer like ropsten.etherscan.io.  This means you're synced, otherwise you have to wait the sync to complete.





# Deploying

First of all, create a new account on your geth. Follow the official docs to do that. 
No surprise, to deploy on a testnet you need fake ethers, you can sort it out starting with Google and searching ropsten faucet. A clever way is to install Metamask, connect to Ropsten and then click Buy. You'll get 1 ether at a time, not bad for testing your contracts.

In assume you're synced and you filled your address with some ethers. 

Now you must unlock your account, on the geth attached console type:
```
> personal.unlockAccount("your address here","your password here")
true
```

Now go back, or open another bash terminal in the project root and type
```
truffle migrate --network=ropsten --reset
```


Hold your breath, if everything is working fine you should see something like (addresses will differ)
```
Using network 'ropsten'.

Otherwise you're in trouble, and *troubles are hard to shoot in Ethereum-land.*



# Why there are no testcases

Well, the code is just subclassing a simple openzeppeling token, it adds nothing really worth test-casing. However, we tested the token manually as asset in ropsten.

# So how can I test

Let's do some token transfer. First, close your geth node and reopen the Ethereum Wallet, let him to sync (should be fast). In the wallet UI you can find how to watch a token, follow the instructions and use your deployed token address, you should see the token in the wallet. Then, you can just send some tokens to another ropsten address (I suggest to use metamask in another machine or in the host OS if you're under a VM). Once you transfer at least a token you can check in ropsten.etherscan.io your token. Just search your token there and you'll get all the goodies.


# What about Parity

We started working with parity but we always got errors while deploying on the ropsten (or even the kovan) testnet. It was impossible for us to figure out what was going wrong. We switched to geth and then we succeeded in deploying and executing contracts on ropsten
